# Reform

Decouple your models from forms. Reform gives you a form object with validations and nested setup of models. It is completely framework-agnostic and doesn't care about your database.

Although reform can be used in any Ruby framework, it comes with [Rails support](#rails-integration), works with [simple_form and other form gems](#formbuilder-support), allows nesting forms to implement [has_one](#nesting-forms-1-1-relations) and [has_many](#nesting-forms-1-n-relations) relationships, can [compose a form](#compositions) from multiple objects and gives you [coercion](#coercion).


## Installation

Add this line to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'reform'
```

## Defining Forms

You're working at a famous record label and your job is archiving all the songs, albums and artists. You start with a form to populate your `songs` table.

```ruby
class SongForm < Reform::Form
  property :title
  property :length

  validates :title,  presence: true
  validates :length, numericality: true
end
```

To add fields to the form use the `::property` method. Also, validations no longer go into the model but sit in the form.


## Using Forms

In your controller you'd create a form instance and pass in the models you wanna work on.

```ruby
class SongsController
  def new
    @form = SongForm.new(Song.new)
  end
```

You can also setup the form for editing existing items.

```ruby
class SongsController
  def edit
    @form = SongForm.new(Song.find(1))
  end
```

## Rendering Forms

Your `@form` is now ready to be rendered, either do it yourself or use something like Rails' `#form_for`, `simple_form` or `formtastic`.

```haml
= form_for @form do |f|

  = f.input :name
  = f.input :title
```

## Validating Forms

After a form submission, you wanna validate the input.

```ruby
class SongsController
  def create
    @form = SongForm.new(Song.new)

    #=> params: {song: {title: "Rio", length: "366"}}

    if @form.validate(params[:song])
```

Reform uses the validations you provided in the form - and nothing else.


## Saving Forms

We provide a bullet-proof way to save your form data: by letting _you_ do it!

```ruby
  if @form.validate(params[:song])

    @form.save do |data, nested|
      data.title  #=> "Rio"
      data.length #=> "366"

      nested      #=> {title: "Rio"}

      Song.create(nested)
    end
```

While `data` gives you an object exposing the form property readers, `nested` is a hash reflecting the nesting structure of your form. Note how you can use arbitrary code to create/update models - in this example, we used `Song::create`.

To push the incoming data to the models directly, call `#save` without the block.

```ruby
    @form.save  #=> populates song with incoming data
                #   by calling @form.song.title= and @form.song.length=.
```


## Nesting Forms: 1-1 Relations

Songs have artists to compose them. Let's say your `Song` model would implement that as follows.

```ruby
class Song < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :artist
end
```

The edit form should allow changing data for artist and song.

```ruby
class SongForm < Reform::Form
  property :title
  property :length

  property :artist do
    property :name

    validates :name, presence: true
  end

  #validates :title, ...
end
```

See how simple nesting forms is? By passing a block to `::property` you can define another form nested into your main form.


### has_one: Setup

This setup's only requirement is having a working `Song#artist` reader.

```ruby
class SongsController
  def edit
    song = Song.find(1)
    song.artist #=> <0x999#Artist title="Duran Duran">

    @form = SongForm.new(song)
  end
```

### has_one: Rendering

When rendering this form you could use the form's accessors manually.

```haml
= text_field :title,         @form.title
= text_field "artist[name]", @form.artist.name
```

Or use something like `#fields_for` in a Rails environment.

```haml
= form_for @form |f|
  = f.text_field :title
  = f.text_field :length

  = f.fields_for :artist do |a|
    = a.text_field :name
```

### has_one: Processing

The block form of `#save` would give you the following data.

```ruby
@form.save do |data, nested|
  data.title #=> "Hungry Like The Wolf"
  data.artist.name #=> "Duran Duran"

  nested #=> {title:  "Hungry Like The Wolf",
         #    artist: {name: "Duran Duran"}}
end
```

Supposed you use reform's automatic save without a block, the following assignments would be made.

```ruby
form.song.title       = "Hungry Like The Wolf"
form.song.artist.name = "Duran Duran"
```

## Nesting Forms: 1-n Relations

Reform also gives you nested collections.

Let's have Albums with songs!

```ruby
class Album < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :songs
end
```

The form might look like this.

```ruby
class AlbumForm < Reform::Form
  property :title

  collection :songs do
    property :title

    validates :title, presence: true
  end
end
```

This basically works like a nested `property` that iterates over a collection of songs.

### has_many: Rendering

Reform will expose the collection using the `#songs` method.

```haml
= text_field :title,         @form.title
= text_field "songs[0][title]", @form.songs[0].title
```

However, `#fields_for` works just fine, again.

```haml
= form_for @form |f|
  = f.text_field :title

  = f.fields_for :songs do |s|
    = s.text_field :title
```

### has_many: Processing

The block form of `#save` will expose the data structures already discussed.

```ruby
@form.save do |data, nested|
  data.title #=> "Rio"
  data.songs.first.title #=> "Hungry Like The Wolf"

  nested #=> {title: "Rio"
         #   songs: [{title: "Hungry Like The Wolf"},
         #          {title: "Last Chance On The Stairways"}]
end
```


## Compositions

Sometimes you might want to embrace two (or more) unrelated objects with a single form. While you could write a simple delegating composition yourself, reform comes with it built-in.

Say we were to edit a song and the label data the record was released from. Internally, this would imply working on the `songs` table and the `labels` table.

```ruby
class SongWithLabelForm < Reform::Form
  include Composition

  property :title, on: :song
  property :city,  on: :label

  validates :title, :city, presence: true
end
```

Note that reform needs to know about the owner objects of properties. You can do so by using the `on:` option.

### Composition: Setup

The constructor slightly differs.

```ruby
@form = SongWithLabelForm.new(song: Song.new, label: Label.new)
```

### Composition: Rendering

After you configured your composition in the form, reform hides the fact that you're actually showing two different objects.

```haml
= form_for @form do |f|

  Song:     = f.input :title

  Label in: = f.input :city
```

### Composition: Processing

When using `#save' without a block reform will use writer methods on the different objects to push validated data to the properties.

Here's how the block parameters look like.

```ruby
@form.save do |data, nested|
  data.title #=> "Rio"
  data.city  #=> "London"

  nested #=> {
         #   song:  {title: "Rio"}
         #   label: {city: "London"}
         #   }
end
```

## Coercion

Often you want incoming form data to be converted to a type, like timestamps. Reform uses [virtus](https://github.com/solnic/virtus) for coercion, the DSL is seamlessly integrated into Reform with the `:type` option.

Be sure to add `virtus` to your Gemfile.

```ruby
require 'reform/form/coercion'

class SongForm < Reform::Form
  include Coercion

  property :written_at, type: DateTime
end

@form.save do |data, nested|
  data.written_at #=> <DateTime XXX>
```


## Agnosticism: Mapping Data

Reform doesn't really know whether it's working with a PORO, an `ActiveRecord` instance or a `Sequel` row.

When rendering the form, reform calls readers on the decorated model to retrieve the field data (`Song#title`, `Song#length`).

When saving a submitted form, the same happens using writers. Reform simply calls `Song#title=(value)`. No knowledge is required about the underlying database layer.

Nesting forms only requires readers for the nested properties as `Album#songs`.


## Rails Integration

Check out [@gogogarret](https://twitter.com/GoGoGarrett/)'s [sample Rails app](https://github.com/gogogarrett/reform_example) using Reform.

Rails and Reform work out-of-the-box. If you're using Rails but for some reason wanna use the pure reform, `require reform/form`, only.


## ActiveModel compliance

Forms in Reform can easily be made ActiveModel-compliant.

Note that this step is _not_ necessary in a Rails environment.

```ruby
class SongForm < Reform::Form
  include Reform::Form::ActiveModel
end
```

If you're not happy with the `model_name` result, configure it manually.

```ruby
class CoverSongForm < Reform::Form
  include Reform::Form::ActiveModel

  model :song
end
```

This is especially helpful when your framework tries to render `cover_song_path` although you wanna go with `song_path`.


## FormBuilder Support

To make your forms work with all the form gems like `simple_form` or Rails `form_for` you need to include another module.

Again, this step is implicit in Rails and you don't need to do it manually.

```ruby
class SongForm < Reform::Form
  include Reform::Form::ActiveModel
  include Reform::Form::ActiveModel::FormBuilderMethods
end
```


## Security

By explicitely defining the form layout using `::property` there is no more need for protecting from unwanted input. `strong_parameter` or `
attr_accessible` become obsolete. Reform will simply ignore undefined incoming parameters.
